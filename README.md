# ðŸ§° Portable Development Setup

> *Stop polluting your system. Start building like a pro.*

A clean, consistent, and fully portable development environment â€” engineered for devs who want control, clarity, and zero local mess.

Built to work across any Windows 11 machine using WSL2, Docker, and VS Code â€” this is how you should be developing in 2025.

## Why This Exists

If you're tired of:

- Installing language versions directly on Windows
- Dealing with path weirdness, environment rot, or global tool conflicts
- Wishing your setup worked exactly the same across machines

â†’ This repo solves that.

Containers for code.  
Freedom for your system.

## Architecture at a Glance

| Layer | Tools | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| Host | VS Code + WSL2 | Lightweight Editor & Shell |
| Runtime | Docker CE (in WSL2) | Container Engine |
| Project | Dev Containers | Language-agnostic Workspaces |

---

## Requirements

### Must-Have

- Windows 11 with WSL2 installed
- Ubuntu (or similar) in WSL2
- Visual Studio Code with Remote & Dev Container Extensions
- Docker CE installed inside WSL2 (No Docker Desktop!)

### Optional Tools

| Tool | Why? |
|------|------|
| GitHub Desktop | Use it if you like it. VS Code Git works fine too. |
| Windows Terminal | Makes working with multiple shells easier. |

## Setup Flow

1. [`base-setup.md`](./base-setup.md) â†’ Prepare your system (WSL2 + Docker CE)
2. [`dev-containers.md`](./dev-containers.md) â†’ Understand Dev Containers
3. Pick a stack guide:
   - [`javascript.md`](./stacks/javascript.md)
   - [`mern-stack.md`](./stacks/mern-stack.md)
   - [`python.md`](./stacks/python.md)

Build once. Run anywhere.
